        You are interested how the magic behind the scene happens?  <br>
        Here you go: <br> <br>

        1. First, the user types in from where to where he wants to go.<br> <br>

        2. The backend process starts after the users selected the car,his driving style <br> and how much the battery of the car is currently charged, with pressing the start button.<br> <br>

        3. After calculating the route and getting all the data for the selected car from our database, <br>we search for all charging stations along the route with a maximum distance between 3km and 7km,<br> depending on the distance of the trip. <br><br>

        4. Then we choose the best fitting charging stations for the trip, depending on the weather, <br> car, driving style, plug types and more. <br><br>

        5. For the selected charging stations we get all the data like the price, address and provider from our database. <br><br>

        6. Following, we calculate the total price, charging time, driving time and more. <br><br>

        7. Finally, we send all the data back, load the selected charging stations into google maps <br>and display everything nicely designed for the user.
